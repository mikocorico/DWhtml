 <p> Do you really want to buy this jacket ? </p>
  <p> Or do you just like the website ?</p>

  <p>The aim of The Aesthetics Project is exactly to answer these questions, </br>
    and to know to what extent does the appearance and design of websites influence how we perceive
    the authenticity of its content ? </p> -->

  <p class="p1">Since our topic had to be related to a digital phenomenon that is present in our daily lives,
    we started at, well, the beginning and thought about what digital platform we encounter every single
    day of our lives. That was obviously the Web. From then on, we tried to find some variable that acts
    somewhat as the lowest c e Web, but what is it exactly? Is it the content of the page or the layout
    and its appearance that is speaking more loudly to our brains? Or both? This lead us to ask the following
    critical issue that has become the central theme of our project:</p>

    <p class="pb"><strong> To what extent does the appearance and design of websites influence how we
      perceive the authenticity of its content? </strong></p>

</div>

<div id="why_OR">
  <p><img src="images_avec_captions/png/why_OR.png" alt="Why Online Retailing" /></p>

  <p class="p1">Now, you can find anything and everything on the Web, and since we could not possibly cover every aspect of the
     appearance of websites which would have led to too much of a generalisation, we chose the online clothing retailing sector
     , focusing solely on websites from brands and retails that also have a physical retail store besides their online presence.
      The reason why we chose this specific topic was because we found it to be in one of the more personal spheres of our private life
      . We believe that choosing what clothes you want to wear, what design they have, what brand it is etc. is a very personal choice,
       meaning that the individual is more likely to be alert of the authenticity of the website, setting it as a prerequisite (in contras
       t to when you simply want to look up a definition of a word for example). In addition to that, data shows and forecasts that ecommerce
        clothing will very likely continue to rise in the next years, making it a most relevant topic for us today. </p>

<div id="literature">

<!-- <h1 id="literature">Literature Review</h1> -->
  <p class="p1"> Of course, we are aware of the fact that, as with everything in this world,
    there are a lot of other/outside factors that play a role in the choice of the buyer to
     ultimately decide to get a piece of clothing. Therefore, we had a look at what experts
     had to say about what tendencies people have and what they take into account when shopping
     for clothes in general. </p>

<!-- <h1 id="survey">Survey</h1>

  <h2 class="sous_titres"> The Methods </h2>
  <p class="p1"> In order to keep in step with the spirit of this project, we decided to go for online surveys to collect the
    necessary data for our analysis. We also found it to be the most relevant and effective method, since we do live in the
    Internet Age. Furthermore, we assumed that people were much more likely to fill out an anonymous online survey an
    d give us more accurate and true answers than if we were to ask random individuals on the street.
    The variety and richness to the results will also be evident since we would not be geographically limited;
    meaning we could easily send the survey to our friends of all ages and backgrounds all across the world with an easy click (or two).
     We are aware of the downside of this as well however, namely that variables of the data sample will be fixed depending on who
    decides to take this online survey rather than us deciding whether we want to ask a young woman of Asian origin rather than
     an old man of French origin (for example). </p>

    <div class="p2"> <p> We would like to thank all those
    who did get complete the survey, as well as all
    those who supported us along the production of
    this statistical inquiry. </br>
    The Aesthetics project is part of Sciences Po's
    "Introduction to Digital Culture" assessment. </p> </div>

    <div class="p1_conc"> <p> As predicted and expected, the appearances of the websites influence our decisions a lot, which naturally has an effect on our lives
     – even if it is only to a small extent for some people. In the light of the analysis of our data, we can say that it is much easier/harder
     (depending on the point of view) to convince people in this digital age, where the authenticity of the data one can gather online is not
     always equivalent to the neatness of its layout. It’s easier for people or organisations of non-serious or less formal nature to convince
     people by simply putting a bit more effort (or to invest more) into the design of their webpage. There are software that give you access to
      a pre-designed, neat and authentic-looking website that you can construct the way you want, skipping the (tedious) step of coding the whole
       page oneself. On the contrary, it might be harder for authentic personas, organisations or institutions to persuade the public of their
      authenticity, since they are “on par” with all the other organisations of various levels or seriousness/legitimacy behind the blue-light
      screen. A good example are official government websites, that often lack in aesthetic pleasantry. </p> </div>
